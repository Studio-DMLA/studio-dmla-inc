      "I had the privilege of working with Maria Paula from 2007 to 2010 when she worked for one of the most emblematic retail companies in Brazil and a case of corporate success for the world, Casas Bahia. As CEO of a design company, I collaboratively developed projects focusing on organizational culture, internal marketing, events, and corporate campaigns, among others. “I also met Robert at that time. He was already a promising designer who moved up to another area of digital marketing and communication, becoming a specialist in front-end development today. “In addition to the professionalism present in the careers of both founders, I have to highlight their human side, which is fully reflected in the operations and the excellent team assembled by Studio DMLA. I see the constant concern with having a humanized, kind, and cordial service with both partners and customers.",
